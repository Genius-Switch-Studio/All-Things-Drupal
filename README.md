base-drupal-module-script
=========================

Script to install/enable base modules for Drupal sites.


## Makefile

This will be used for create new sites. I'll have 2 setup: 1 for Commerce Kickstart sites and one for standard setups.


## Module.sh

This can be used for existing sites. That said, when the makefiles are created and up to date we shouldn't have much use for this.
