All Things Drupal
=========================

This is repo combines the original d7-stack rep and genius-drupal-scripts repo into one. 

It also adds a preflight checklist for drupal sites.

Preflight Checklist
===================

List of things to be done before we launch a production Drupal site.


drupal-stack
============

A base drupal stack that Rowan created.


Scripts
=======

Script to install/enable base modules for Drupal sites.


## Makefile

This will be used for create new sites. I'll have 2 setup: 1 for Commerce Kickstart sites and one for standard setups.


## Module.sh

This can be used for existing sites. That said, when the makefiles are created and up to date we shouldn't have much use for this.
